# SWQU User's Meeting Tutorial

In this part of the tutorial, we will use the fully spherical grid to create a SW solution using a time-dependent BCs generated by SWiG. The BCs have multiple frames spanning about 2 weeks.

The BC files generated by SWiG have been placed in the `/BC_files` directory and they need to be converted to a single h5 file that can be read by HelioCubed.

## Steps for Running the Code

1. **Navigate to the proto directory and set the branch to `Master` using:**
   ```bash
   git branch Master

2. **Navigate to HelioCubed directory/scripts.**
   ```bash
   cd scripts
   
3. **Run the Python script to convert multiple frames generated by SWiG to a single h5 file.**
   ```bash
   python3 SWiG_to_HelioCubed_h5_conversion.py

A new file will be generated in the /scripts directory. It has already been added in the inputs file to be used when running HelioCubed

4. **Navigate to HelioCubed directory/exec.**
   ```bash
   cd ../exec

5. **Edit the GNUMakefile with the correct paths to proto, and hdf5 and save the file.**

6. **Compile HelioCubed using**
   ```bash
   make -j8

7. **The code can now be run using**
    ```bash
    mpirun -n 8 FullSphere.exe inputs

8. **The inputs file can be edited to set desired parameters of the run.**

9. **The generated Probe file can be plotted using:**
   ```bash
   python3 ../Plot_sim.py
