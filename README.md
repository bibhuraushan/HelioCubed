# SWQU User's Meeting Tutorial

In this part of the tutorial, we will use the fully spherical grid to create a SW solution using a time-dependent BCs generated by SWiG. The BCs have multiple frames spanning about 2 weeks.

The BC files generated by SWiG have been placed in the `/BC_files` directory and they need to be converted to a single h5 file that can be read by HelioCubed.

## Steps for Running the Code

- **Navigate to HelioCubed directory/scripts.**
   ```bash
   cd scripts
   
- **Run the Python script to convert multiple frames generated by SWiG to a single h5 file.**
   ```bash
   python3 SWiG_to_HelioCubed_h5_conversion.py

A new file will be generated in the /scripts directory. It has already been added in the inputs file to be used when running HelioCubed

- **Navigate to HelioCubed directory/exec.**
   ```bash
   cd ../exec

- **Edit the GNUMakefile with the correct paths to proto, and hdf5 and save the file.**

- **Compile HelioCubed using**
   ```bash
   make -j8

- **The code can now be run using**
    ```bash
    mpirun -n 8 FullSphere.exe inputs

- **The inputs file can be edited to set desired parameters of the run.**

- **The generated Probe file can be plotted using:**
   ```bash
   cd ../scripts
   python3 Plot_sim.py
- **The generated hdf5 files will be visualized using VisIt.**
    The mapping to spherical domain will require creation of an expression `disp` as a Vector Mesh Variable
    ```bash
    {X,Y,Z}-coord(Mesh)
